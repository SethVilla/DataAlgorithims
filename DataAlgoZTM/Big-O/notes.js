/*

    What is good good code?
    - readability and scalability.

    We are looking to determine Algorithmic efficiency.

    Runtime?
    - How does our runtime grow as our input grows
    - How does the efficiency of our operation grow

    Calculate Big O Rules

    - by finding worst case  O(1 + 2n) = O(n)
    - Remove Constants / Drop Constants O(2n) = O(n)
    - Different terms for inputs O(n + a)
